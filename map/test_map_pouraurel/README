just run the .sh with the name of the test

ALL THE TEST ARE COMPILE WITH -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98

If something is written before the "############## leaks test ####################" line, there is a problem (the max size difference is not a probleme)

else there are no probleme, then the leaks are checked
